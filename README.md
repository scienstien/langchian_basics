This is my submisssion of spider task2A. I have used langchain and streamlit to create a rag application. I have defined 2 defferent retrieval chians. One uses local model, the other uses cloud based google-gemni-turbo. The reason i opted for a local model is becasue streamlit runs into lot of errors loading the .env file even if it is saved propery, it sometimes out of the blue doesnot detect the api keyts
